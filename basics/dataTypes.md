# Datatypes in C++ 

Datatypes in C++ are mainly divided into three types: 

1. **Primitive Data Types**: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be directly used by the user to declare variables.

    integer(**int**), character(**char**), boolean(**bool**) , floating point(**float**), double floating point (**double**), valueless(**void**), wide characters(**wchar_t**) 


`A wide character, also known as wchar_t in C++, is a data type used to represent a wide character, which is a character that can take up more than one byte of storage. It is commonly used to store characters from non-Latin scripts, such as Chinese or Arabic, which require more than one byte to represent a character.` 

2. **Derived Data Types**: Data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types: 

    **Function, Array, Pointer, Reference** 

3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: These data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. Following are user-defined datatypes in C++: 

    **Class, Structure, Union, Enumeration** 


 `Typedef defined Datatype - typedef is a keyword in C++ that allows you to create a new name for an existing data type. It can be used to give a data type a more descriptive or abbreviated name, which can make your code more readable and maintainable. `
